# The Self
- Is one really a "Looking glass self" (Cooley)
- Defining the Self

## Self-Concept
- Sense if identity, set of beliefs we hold about what we are like as individuals (personality)

## Self-Schema
- Organized body of information that relates to some aspect of a person's self
- Differences in Self-Definition
    - Gender
        - Females focus on relational interdependence (social roles)
        - Males focus on group membership (collective interdependence)
    - Cultural - Independent vs. interdependent

## Knowing the self
- Focusing on the self - how well do we know ourselves
- Introspection -does not always yield accurate results

## Comparing ourselves to others
- Social comparison - use opinions and abilities of other to evaluate ourselves
    - Usually occurs in the absence of objective social reality
    - Upward comparison
    - Downward comparison
- Above average effect

## Defining the self through behavior
- Self-Perception Theory (Bem)
    - People construct their self-definition by observing their behavior (given weak or ambiguous situational causes)
- Misattribution of Arousal (Dutton & Aron)
    - Mistaken inference about what is causing people to feel the way they do 

## Evaluating and Protecting the Self
- Self-esteem 
    - Affective component of the self. Positive or negative self-evaluations
- Misperceptions of the self
    - Self-serving bias
    - Actor-Observer bias

# Attitudes
- Stable mental view of some object, person, or idea (Eagly & Chaiken, 1993)
- Components
    - Affect
    - Behavior
    - Cognition
- Attitudes predict behavior
    - Situational pressure
    - How specifically the attitude is defined
    - Strength of attitude

## Attitude/Behavior Inconsistency
- Cognitive Dissonance
    - Unpleasant psychological state produced by inconsistencies between beliefs, feelings, or behavior
- Inducers of Dissonance
    - Justification of effort
    - Post-decisional dissonance
    - Forced compliance

## Attitude change
- Central route - reasoned thought
    - You listen to the persuasion and you rate the merits
- Peripheral route - Heuristics
    - We use external stimulus to rate the metrics

# Perceiving Others
- Stereotypes - group schemas
    - Illusory correlatoins - expected behaviors
- In-group, out-group bias
- Out-group homogeneity - they are all alike, but different from us

## Perceiving others
- Prejudice
    - Negative attitude towards another based on group membership
- Discrimination
    - Negative behavior towards another based on group membership

## Judging others
- Attribution - looking for causes of behavior
    - Internal - dispositional
    - External - situational

## Attributional Biases
- Fundamental Attribution Error
    - Overreliance on internal attributions, while underestimating situational ones
- Self-serving bias
    - Take credit for success, blame others for failure
- Actor/observer Bias
    - Explain behavior differently depending on whether one is the actor or observing the behavior (self, external; others. internal)

# Social Influence
- Social facilitation
    - Change in behavior as the result of the presence of others
- Zajonc - we are aroused by the mere presence of others
    - Increase dominant, well-learned response, inhibit others

## Types of social influence

### Conformity
- Voluntarily change behavior to follow beliefs or standards of others
    - Information influence - being right
    - Normative influence - being liked

### Compliance
- Comply with a request by an individual or group
- Norm of Reciprocity 
    - Must repay to others what has been given to us
- Foot-in-the-door
    - Small request is used to gain compliance with a larger request
- Door-in-the-face
    - large request which is likely to be refused is used to gain compliance with a smaller request
- That's not all
    - Individual complies on the basis on incomplete information

# Group Dynamics
- Social loafing
    - Work less hard in the presence of others
- Deindividuation
    - Decreased feeling of self-awareness prompted by anonymity and loosening of social constraints in a group

## Helping
- Bystander Effect-Lack of helping due to the presence of others
    - Ambiguity in the situation
    - Pluralistic ignorance - assume others understand the situation
    - Diffusion of responsibility
