# Early Interactions
- From a very early age, infants are interested in face-to-face interaction

## Social referencing
- When infants begin to crawl (7 to 9 months), they begin to rely on facial cues
    - For instance, if the infants crawls into a dangerous or inappropriate situation

## Separation anxiety
- Infants begin to feel **separation anxiety** between 6 and 8 months
- Bowlby
    - Infants have a need for contact comfort, which provides the infant with a secure base


## Social Development
### Attachment - Survival impulse (bond) that keeps infants close to their caregivers
- Attachment shapes the child's expectations about the social world
    - Cupboard theory of attachment
- Attachment is assessed by observing behavior of children in the Strange Situation
    - Securely attached
    - Anxious/resistant
    - Anxious/avoidant attachment 
    - Disorganized pattern of attachment
- Types of attachment
    - Secure-Needs consistently met
    - Avoidant - Neglectful or dismissive caregivers
    - Anxious/Ambivalent - inconsistent treatment
        - Ainsworth Strange situation
- Attachment style
    - Relatively stable, but they can change if the circumstances change

        - Imprinting - in animals
    - Mother vs. Father attachment
        - Mothers - comfort and care
        - Father - activate play
        - Both figures serve as a secure base
    - Daycare / Childcare
        - Attachment doe snot seem to be disrupted by childcare, especially if it's of high quality
        - Social development may be disrupted by divorce or separation of the parents

    - Permissive - try not to assert authority or use discipline
    - Authoritative (reciprocal) - set rules but also respond to child's view

### Peer Relationships
- Friendships are important
    - Provide support
    - Help children gain various skills and knowledge
        - Children learn how to handle conflict by quarreling - and then making up - with their friends
