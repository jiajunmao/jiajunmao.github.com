- Express thought
- Conveys information
- Expresses and solidifies social and cultural bonding

# Building Block of Language
- Language consists of a hiearchy of units
    - They combine and recombine to form higher level categories
- At the bottom are 
    - Units of sound

# Phonemes
- Sound categories that matter in a language are called its phonemes
    - English uses about 40 different phonemes
- Other languages hav their own sets of phonemes

# Morphemes
- The smallest language units that carry meaning are morphemes
    - Content morpheme 
        - Carry the main burden of meaning
    - Function morphemes
        - Add retail to the meaning

# Language structure
- Rules of syntax
    - Some sequences of words are allowed, but others are not
        - Tree diagram

# Language Acquisition
## Learning (Skinner)
- We are reinforced for making sounds or words

## Nativist (Chromsky)
- We are biologically predisposed to learn language
    - Structure of the human mouth is conductive to speech production
  
## Learning for Babies
- From birth, infants' ears and minds are open to detect the sounds of language
    - And also to organize these sounds into words
- Initially, infants respond to all sound distinctions made in any language
    - By 12 month of age, they are more sensitive to sound in their own language

## Stages of Language Acquisition
### Babbling stage
- Utter various sounds, 3 to 4 months

### One-word stage
- By age 1

### Two-word
- 18 to 25 months
- Exemplifies telegraphic speech (mostly nouns and verbs)

## Learning Progress
- Children's speech progresses very rapidly by age3
    - Little sentences and use of function words
- Overregularization errors
    - There is evidence that children don't learn language by imitation: they learn rules

## Learning and Environment
- Under normal conditions, language emerges in same way in all children
    - Consistent ith the claim that language development is rooted in shared biological heritage
- But what happens when children grow up in radically different environment

## Isolated Children
- Normal language development may take place as language learning begins during a sensitive period
    - The sensitive period may end at the age of puberty

# Sign Language
- Babies born to deaf users of sign language go through the same steps as do earing children learning English
- Thus, language must not depend on the auditory vocal channel

# Blind Children
- Blind children learn language as rapidly and as well as sighted children do
- Here too, language emerges in all its complexity and on schedule

# Animals and Languages
- Evidence suggests animals can learn words, and have rudimentary propositional thought
- But there's little evidence they can create syntactic structures that human use
