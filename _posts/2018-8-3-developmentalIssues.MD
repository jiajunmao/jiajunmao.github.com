# Major Developmental Issue
## Nature vs Nurture
- Both prenatal environment rand environment after birth are important

## Contiguity vs Stage
## Stability vs Change

# Prenatal Development
- Zygote - fertilized egg
- Embryo - 2 weeks after fertilization
- Fetus - 9 weeks from conception

# Capabilities of Newborns
- Newborns have many capabilities, some present at birth
- **Rooting reflex** - in response to touch on cheek, baby will move mouth to the side in search of food
- Sucking
- Palmer reflex - grasping

# Physical Development
- Memory - begins around ages 3 or 4
- **Plasticity** - neural tissues reorganize in response to damage
- Motor skills - experience has little effect on timing

# Cognitive Development
- Cognitive - all mental activity associated with thinking, knowing, and remembering

## Piaget's Stages of Cognitive Development
### Sensorimotor
- Understand the world through sensory and motor interactions
    - Object permanence - A-not-B effect
    - Stranger anxiety
- Typical age range - birth to 2 years

### Preoperational stages
- Unable to perform mental operations
    - Egocentrism - cannot perceive things from another's point of view
    - Ability to pretend
- Typical age - 2-6 years

### Concrete operational
- Understand mathematical transformation and conversation
    - Conversation - quality of a substance is conserved despite changes in its shape
    - Mathematical transformations
    - Abstract logic
- Typical age range - 7-11 ages

### Formal Operational
- Capable of solving hypothetical propositions and deducing consequences
    - Abstract reasoning
    - Potential for Moral reasoning
    - Typical age range 12 through adulthood


## Beyond Piget
- Studies of visual perception using habituation procedures suggest, despite Piaget's claim, that infants have
    - Built-in understanding of the physical world
    - Some concept of object permanence

# Cognitive development
## Schemas - ways of looking at the world that organize our past experiences
- Assimilation - incorporate new experiences into existing schema
- Accommodation - adjust schema to fit new experience

# Other cognitive milestones
- Number operations
- Existence of Other's mind

## Number and Math Reasoning
- Further studies show that infants can perceive numerical equivalences
    - Provided the number of objects in the set is small enough
- And they have some numerical reasoning

## Social Cognition
- Piaget also underestimated infants' capacity for social cognition
    - Infants seem to understand others' actions in terms of their goals, and not in terms of the specific movement themselves
